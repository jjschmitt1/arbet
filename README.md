Hello! My name is JJ Schmitt and this is one of my passion projects, arbet!

I am an avid sports watcher and I want to get into the space of working with data / apis. I thought a good way to combine this skills (other than making a simple stat observer) was to try and find arbitrage 
within the sports betting world. Plus, if it works it might be a way to make a quick buck :). I thought it was interesting, that in 2024 Americans gambled over $140 BILLION (according to Legal Sports Report).
Figured I would try to tap in. 

For help with how to run the program, run the program with the -help flag.
